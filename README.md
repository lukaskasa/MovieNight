# Movie Night iOS App

Movie Night makes it easy for two parties to choose a movie they both like. By accessing the Movie DB API (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3), both movie watchers select five genres, five actors and three decades of their choice. The Movie DB API endpoint then picks the movie upon the commonality of parameters. Both movie enthusiasts make their choices on three different UITableviews. The fourth UITableView appears once both watchers made their selections.
